I am Alessandro Lonardi, a PhD student at the <a href="https://is.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a> (TÃ¼bingen, Germany), working under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://cdebacco.com/">Caterina De Bacco</a> in the <a href="https://is.mpg.de/employees?_=1598796063852&action=index&controller=employees&departments=pio&query=&utf8=\%E2\%9C\%93">Physics for Inference and Optimization group</a>. Previous to that, I was a Master's student in Mathematical Engineering at <a href="https://www.unipd.it/en/">University of Padova</a> (Padua, Italy), where I also obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics. <br/>

My PhD is supported by the <a href="https://imprs.is.mpg.de">International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems</a> (IMPRS-IS), which is part of the <a href="https://cyber-valley.de/en">Cyber Valley</a> initiative.

Originally I am from the small village of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LnPtj2FqxjT1W1pg6">San Floriano</a>, located in the beautiful <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valpolicella_classica">Valpolicella classica</a> (historical production area of Valpolicella wines), close to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona">Verona</a>, Italy.

<h1>Research</h1>

My current research mainly focuses on developing mathematical models for optimization problems on networks. More in detail, I study dynamical systems to explain how networks can optimally adapt their structure to accommodate multiple agents interacting along their edges. I am also interested in message-passing algorithms for statistical inference. The applications of my work are primarily in urban networks and machine learning but potentially span several other disciplines, such as climate science and biology. Broadly speaking, I like to address data-rich problems where mechanistic models and inferential predictions mutually benefit from each other.
